TopsTVPlayer
============

Android video player which plays real-time live video stream and on demand video stream, supporting HTTP/RTSP protocol.

##Notes:
- **Android client part** of a complete online video serving system. It does not support playing local videos.

- **Server part** of this online video system includes: a media server (Helix), a web server (Tomcat 6) and a database server (MySQL). Deployments of all those servers are requisites to make this app work.

- Deployment guides of server part are (hopefully) coming soon....
